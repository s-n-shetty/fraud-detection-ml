# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning models. The objective was to build a classification system that can identify high-risk transactions accurately.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared transactional data
- Addressed class imbalance in the dataset
- Built and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
- Evaluated performance using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

## Why It Matters
Fraud detection systems help reduce financial losses and improve trust in payment systems. Even small improvements in detection can have significant business impact.

## Tech Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
